# Introduction

What are the problems that havenâ€™t been solved in unifying the block chain ecosystem and allowing chain specific use cases to be composable accross multiple chains to better drive utilization of the whole ecosystem

# Scenarios
This is an on-going list of development and research ideas.

## Asset Portability

## High Speed Low Cost Gaming Frameworks

## Cheaper Data Storage


# Blockchain Setting

## Cross-Chain Consensus Proofs

Old - Light Clients and Merkle Trees disparate consenus proving approaches

New - ZK Proofs 

Benchmarks 

## Cross-chain messaging

Old - Siloed Solutions Cosmos IBC, Polkadot XCMP

New - Standard Message Framework with Chain Specific Adapters

BenchMarks

## ZK Proofs

Old - Siloed proving of e.g. Block validity via signatures

New - Hub and spoke model. Prove once and verify on multiple chains

BenchMarks

## Message Relays

Old - Provers, Relayers, Schedulers (Keeper Network, Off Chain Workers)

New - Event Based Multi Chain Network

Benchmarks


## Bridged Transaction Processing

Old - Transaction Processors, Token Lockers, Execution Layer, Consensus Layer Contracts

New -
 
Benchmarks -
